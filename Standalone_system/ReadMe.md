the codes under this folder are all of a different configrational way we can exicute the program 

instead of using 3d ploting 2d image will be overlayed
and haar_cascade classifier is used instead of Yolo

I settled for this because of computatonal limitations of my raspberry pi 5 
we can use yolo nano if we integrate An NPU to raspberry pi and change the yolo format to tensor flow lite

the programs in the parent directory are for an dristibuted system where all the computational is off loaded to the connected system

add cars.xml haar classifier trained model or any other model to exicute object detection and 2d images that you will want to overlay

move the repo folder to raspberry pi this time
